- Practice changing our behaviour that gives understanding of how behaviour works
- Behaviour change is systematic
- Long term behaviour change needs change in environment
- Relaying on motivation for long term behaviour change is not reliable
-  Behaviours contribute to outcomes which are eventually tiny habits
-  By growing little tiny habbits we can change our life
- Things that causes behaviour:
  - Motivation
  - Ablity to do
  - Trigger to do
- High motivation helps us to start the task but we wont last much with it
- What we need is the easy to do mentality to kick off the habit
- Develop the tiny habits in such a way that we are able to connect with something that we love to do
- Plant your new habit that you are going to develop at the right spot and then let the natural process take care of it



-  Small habits and choices transforms us everyday
-  Instead of focusing on rapid success focus on aggregation of small wins
-  Habits are the compound interest of self improvement
-  Four stages of habit formation
 - noticing
 - wanting
 - doing
 - liking
- Many people believe that they lack motivation where they really lack is clarity
- we need to bring up a detailed plan of implementation to get the task done 
- when we have to do a task which we know is going to take some time to get completed,for such tasks the trick is to get started.
- Put out all of your energy to get started and not on the finishline
- Often good habits have delayed rewards and come out with only immediate consequences
- Bad habits comes with immediate reward which actually adds up to  delayed consequences
- For good habits we need some sort of immediate reward that is some short term feedback for long term goal
- Develop a habit of noting down your accomplishment for the day.Once you move forward that'll give us the reward we need
- Dont break the chain of doing that even if you do break dont break it twice at a time
- Actions that we take provide evidence for what we are now
- Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become
- Habits are not only for achieveing external change but through which we achieve internal change that will help us become someone new
- Habits are the way to forge our identity, deepest beliefs about of ourselves and sense of self
